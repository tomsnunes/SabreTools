## Introduction

The SabreTools project started as a desktop port of some core features of Wizard of DATz Redux, but it has since grown into a fully-featured DAT management tool. Below is a brief description of the features available in the suite. For more information about each feature, see the help text in each of the programs. For more information about the parent project, see [here](https://github.com/SabreTools/wizzardRedux).

## Features

For the most complete set of information, see the [README.1ST](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SabreTools/SabreTools/master/SabreTools.Helper/README.1ST) file. Currently, the SabreTools suite consists of the following programs:

### SabreTools / SabreTools.Library

As the core of the SabreTools suite, C# library provides nearly all of the functionality, while the main executable acts as a reference implementation. Below is a list of features included in the library and exposed though the executable:

* **Dir2DAT / DATFromDir** - Create a DAT from a file, folder, or mix of both
	* Archives and files can be filtered selectively
	* Archives can be treated like files, that is, it will get an external hash only
	* Multiple input archive formats are supported: 7zip, GZip, RAR, TAR, and ZIP/ZIP64
	* Multiple hashing algorithms available, up to SHA-512
	* Created DATs can be output in multiple formats at once, including ClrMamePro, Logiqx XML, and RomCenter
	* All DAT fields can be set for the output
	* Files with copier headers can be checked for additional hashes
* **DAT Conversion** - Convert DATs between numerous formats, including standards such as ClrMamePro, Logiqx XML, and RomCenter
	* Converted DATs can be output in multiple formats at once
	* Filtering can be done on all DATs based on criteria such as item type, sizes, hashes, and names
	* Input DATs can optionally be merged and diffed with each other
	* All DAT fields can be updated during the conversion
* **DAT Splitting** - Split DATs based on multiple different criteria
	* Split by user-defined extensions into two DATs
	* Split by best-available hash, e.g. SHA-1
	* Split a SuperDAT on the lowest available directory level
	* Split by DAT item types
* **DAT Statistics** - Get statistics on a DAT or folder of DATs
	* Includes items such as rom and game counts
	* Includes the total uncompressed size of all items
	* Optionally includes statistics on individual DATs in a folder
	* Reports can be output in standard text, CSV, and/or HTML formats
* **Extract and Restore Copier Headers** - Extract and store or restore from DB copier headers
	* Supports copier headers from the following systems:
		* Atari 7800
		* Atari Lynx
		* Commodore 64 PSID music
		* NEC PC-Engine / TurboGrafx 16
		* Nintendo Famicom Disk System
		* Nintendo Entertainment System / Famicom
		* Super Nintendo Entertainment System / Super Famicom
		* Super Nintendo Entertainment System / Super Famicom SPC music
	* Stores the header information linked to unheadered hash
* **Rebuild From DAT** - Act as a simple rebuilder for files
	* Two options for rebuild origin: standard folder and Romba depot
	* Multiple output formats: unarchived, TAR, TorrentZip, 7zip, XZ, TorrentGZ
	* Can rebuild from multiple DATs at the same time
	* Cross-check with multiple hashing algorithms, up to SHA-512
	* Can output a fixdat based on the rebuilt files
* **Verify From DAT** - Act as a simple verifier for files
	* Two options for verification target: standard folder and Romba depot
	* Exact verification and hash-only verification both available
	* Can verify from multiple DATs at the same time
	* Cross-check with mutliple hashing algorithms, up to SHA-512

This tool has a comprehensive list of command line parameters that can be used to do the above and much more.

### RombaSharp

An in-progress tool that will try to act as a C# port of the Go-based [Romba](https://github.com/uwedeportivo/romba/) program. All features that are not already a part of SabreTools will be attempted to be added to this program. It is NOT ready for use yet. For any inquiries into the full features of this tool, please contact the project.
